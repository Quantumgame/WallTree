A VHDL code generator for wallace tree multiplier.

The problem statement is inspired from my friend Arjun Shankar, who developed a nice little application in Java to generate synthesizable VHDL code for the Wallace Tree multiplier.

Due to lack of motivation, I haven't touched my C++ application since a long time. I hope to complete it sometime and update it here. 

The implementation by Arjun, takes care of registered/un-registered versions as well as signed/unsigned multiplication. I have no willingness to immplement those. Again, due to lack of motivation.
